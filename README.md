# Analysis of Ad AB Test Results  

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a creative, interactive online advertisement for the SmartAd brand by comparing it to a standard control ad.  
The goal is to determine whether the creative ad leads to higher user engagement.  

### Key Findings  

- User Interaction: Users interacted more with interactive ads, with higher frequencies of "yes" or "no" responses.
- Statistical Significance: A significant difference in the number of "yes" responses to interactive ads was observed.
- Distribution Issues: Imbalances in user distribution by browsers, operating systems, and devices were noted. Ad impressions were uneven, though user ratios between groups were correct.

### Recommendations  

- Follow-Up Test: Conduct with improved technical implementation, ensuring even ad impressions and balanced data distributions.
- Extended Duration: Extend the test duration to two weeks to identify weekly and hourly variations for better ad budget optimization.
